## Project: QuickCache

**QuickCache** is a desktop app for managing flashcards optimized for fast typers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to open a flashcard.
  * What it does: allows the user to open a flashcard based on its index in the list. Opening a flashcard displays the question of the flashcard and its choices provided that the flashcard's question is a multiple-choice question.
  * Justification: This feature is integral for the product to be effective because a user can forget the choices to answering the question associated with the flashcard if the question is multiple choice and the app should provide a convenient way for the user to refer to them.
  *  Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing GUI and functionalities to be added in the future. It required careful consideration of how it is to be implemented. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing GUI and needs to ensure backward compatibility with it.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display the statistics of a flashcard.
  * What it does: allows the user to request to display a flashcard's statistics based on its index in the list. The statistics are displayed to the user in the form of a pie chart.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary for the app to achieve it's purpose of helping users improve in their academics because a user needs to know where he/she stands to decide on the amount of effort they need to put in ahead and the app should provide a simple way for the user to evaluate his/her performance.
  *  Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing GUI and functionalities to be added in the future. It required careful consideration of how it is to be implemented. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing GUI and needs to ensure backward compatibility with it.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to clear the statistics of a flashcard.
  * What it does: allows the user to clear a flashcard's statistics based on its index in the list. The statistics are reset back to zero for all attributes that are tracked for each flashcard.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as the user might want to get rid of the previous statistics associated with a flashcard as it may no longer be a relevant gauge of his current performance and therefore the app needs to provide a way for the user to achieve that.
  *  Highlights: This enhancement is relatively simple as it just needs to replace the current statistics associated with the flashcard with a default one set to all zeros. The implementation did not take too much time and effort.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find a flashcard by tags and/or keywords.
  * What it does: allows the user to find a flashcard by specifying keywords in its question and/or tags associated with it. The flashcards matching the specified criteria are displayed in a list to the user.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as the user might have a lot of flashcards and doesn't want to spend too much time scrolling through the list searching for the flashcard. The app therefore needs to cater for this by providing a simple and efficient way for the user to filter the flashcards in the list based on its attributes such as the keywords or tags associated with it.
  *  Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing implementation of the find command. It required careful consideration of how it is to be implemented. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing find command which only accepted keywords and allowing finding using both tags and keywords proved to be a non trivial task.
  * Credits: *{I referred to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/86780) in order to allow for a case-insensitive "contains" implementation for finding with keywords. In simple words, this allows keywords such as "HEL" to pick up a flashcard which has "Hello world" as its question.}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the find command to allow searching using keywords and/or tags (Pull request [\#110](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/110))

* **Contribution to team-based tasks**:
  * Morphed the GUI to display flashcards instead of people. ([Pull request \#59](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/59))
  * Renamed all instances of Addressbook and Person into QuickCache and Flashcard in the test code. ([Pull request \#94](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/94/files))
  * Updated the command summary section to make it clearer. Built the table using HTML from scratch as it provided more features as compared to markdown's table. ([Pull request \#160](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/160))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `open`, `stats`, `clearstats` and `find` ([Pull request \#160](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/160))
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing command summary section ([Pull request \#160](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/160))
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details for the features `open`, `stats`, `clearstats` and `find` ([Pull request \#136](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/136))

* **Community**:
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](https://github.com/FH-30/ped/issues/1), [2](https://github.com/FH-30/ped/issues/2), [3](https://github.com/FH-30/ped/issues/3), [4](https://github.com/FH-30/ped/issues/4))
