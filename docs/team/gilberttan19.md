## Project: QuickCache

**QuickCache** is a desktop application used for managing flashcards. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a flashcard with both open ended question and multiple choice question
  * What it does: allows the user to add flashcard one at a time. The flashcard can contains either open ended question or multiple choice question.
  * Justification: This feature is the basic create function in the application and most of the feature depend on the creation of the flashcard.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this enhancement follow closely the OOP principle and use the polymorphism concept in OOP.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a flashcard.
  * What it does: allows the user to edit flashcard one at a time. The flashcard can contains either open ended question or multiple choice question.
  * Justification: This feature is the one of the feature in 1.3 as edit is basically create and delete.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes when creating a flashcard or the user want to update the flashcard and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this enhancement follow closely the OOP principle and use the polymorphism concept in OOP.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete a flashcard by index.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete flashcard one at a time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as there will be too many flashcards as time goes on and the app should provide a convenient way to delete them.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this enhancement follow closely the OOP principle.
